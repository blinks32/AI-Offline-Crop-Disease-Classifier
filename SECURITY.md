# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of the ADTC Smart Crop Disease Classifier with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Features

### Data Privacy
- **Local Processing**: All image analysis is performed on-device
- **No Data Collection**: No user images or personal data are transmitted
- **Offline Operation**: No network permissions required for core functionality
- **Secure Storage**: All app data stored in private app directories

### Application Security
- **Code Obfuscation**: Release builds use ProGuard for code protection
- **Certificate Pinning**: Network communications use certificate pinning
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Memory Protection**: Secure memory handling for sensitive operations

### Model Security
- **Integrity Verification**: AI models are verified for tampering
- **Secure Loading**: Models loaded from secure app assets only
- **Version Control**: Model versioning prevents rollback attacks

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Open Public Issues
- **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- **DO NOT** discuss security issues in public forums or social media

### 2. Contact Us Directly
Send security reports to: **security@adtc.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information

### 3. Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: 1-2 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and deployed

### 4. Responsible Disclosure
We follow responsible disclosure practices:
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- We will investigate and validate the vulnerability
- We will develop and test a fix
- We will release the fix in a security update
- We will publicly acknowledge your contribution (if desired)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Device Security
- Keep your Android device updated with latest security patches
- Only install the app from trusted sources (Google Play Store or official website)
- Verify APK checksums when downloading directly
- Use device lock screen protection

### App Permissions
The app requests minimal permissions:
- **Camera**: Required for crop image capture
- **Storage**: Optional, for saving analysis results

### Safe Usage
- Only analyze your own crops or with proper permission
- Be cautious when sharing analysis results
- Report suspicious app behavior immediately

## Security Measures in Development

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
- **Code Review**: All code changes reviewed for security implications
- **Secure Coding**: Following OWASP mobile security guidelines

### Build Security
- **Signed Releases**: All releases signed with secure certificates
- **Build Reproducibility**: Deterministic builds for verification
- **Supply Chain Security**: Verified dependencies and build tools
- **Secure Distribution**: Multiple distribution channels with integrity checks

### Testing Security
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning for known vulnerabilities
- **Security Unit Tests**: Tests for security-critical functionality
- **Manual Security Review**: Expert review of security implementations

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats
1. **Malicious Model Injection**: Attacker replaces AI model with malicious version
2. **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to user images or analysis results
3. **Code Tampering**: Modification of app code to introduce vulnerabilities
4. **Man-in-the-Middle**: Interception of network communications (if any)
5. **Reverse Engineering**: Extraction of proprietary algorithms or data

### Mitigations
1. **Model Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of model files
2. **Local Processing**: No network transmission of sensitive data
3. **Code Obfuscation**: Protection against reverse engineering
4. **Certificate Pinning**: Prevention of MITM attacks
5. **Secure Architecture**: Defense-in-depth security design

## Compliance and Standards

### Privacy Regulations
- **GDPR Compliance**: No personal data collection or processing
- **CCPA Compliance**: No sale or sharing of personal information
- **Regional Privacy Laws**: Compliance with local data protection regulations

### Security Standards
- **OWASP Mobile Top 10**: Protection against common mobile vulnerabilities
- **Android Security Guidelines**: Following Google's security best practices
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management principles
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Risk-based security approach

## Security Updates

### Update Mechanism
- **Automatic Updates**: Via Google Play Store for most users
- **Manual Updates**: Direct APK downloads with security notifications
- **Emergency Updates**: Fast-track process for critical security fixes
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to quickly revert problematic updates

### Security Notifications
Users will be notified of security updates through:
- Google Play Store update notifications
- In-app security bulletins (for critical issues)
- Official website security advisories
- Email notifications (for registered users)

## Bug Bounty Program
