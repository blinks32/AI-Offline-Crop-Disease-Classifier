## 🚀 The Problem We Solve

- **$220 billion** in global crop losses annually due to diseases
- **Limited access** to agricultural experts in rural areas  
- **Delayed diagnosis** leads to widespread crop damage
- **Traditional methods** require expensive lab testing

**Our Solution:** Real-time, AI-powered crop disease detection that works offline on any Android smartphone.

## 🔬 Key Features

### AI Technology
- **3-Class Neural Network**: Healthy, Diseased, Not-Crop classification
- **MobileNetV2 Base**: Optimized for mobile deployment  
- **1.7MB Model**: Fast inference with INT8 quantization
- **PlantVillage Dataset**: Trained on 50,000+ crop images
- **Sub-second Analysis**: Real-time processing with confidence scoring

### Smart Detection
- **Offline Operation**: No internet required
- **Multi-crop Support**: Apple, tomato, potato, corn, and more
- **Confidence Scoring**: Transparent accuracy metrics
- **Non-crop Rejection**: Distinguishes crops from other objects

## 📊 Performance

- **85-95% accuracy** on trained crop species
- **90%+ accuracy** for disease detection
- **<1 second** processing time per analysis
- **1.7MB model** size for low-end devices

### Supported Crops
Apple • Cherry • Peach • Grape • Tomato • Potato • Bell Pepper • Squash • Corn • Strawberry
